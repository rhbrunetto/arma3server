	NAME: unflip_vehicle.sqf	
	VERSION: 1	
	
	DESCRIPTION:
	If vehicle's angle to ground is over 45 and vehicle has no alive crew,
	shows Unflip vehicle action in player's action menu

	USAGE:
	paste this into init.sqf
	0 = [] execVM 'unflip_vehicle.sqf';
		
	Technically there are two ways to unflip vehicle, this script uses the first one:
	1) Align vehicle back to the surface normal.
	   CONS: This can cause physics to go crazy, because if we change angle of the vehicle
	    	 it might be inside object, so you have to disable damage and set velocity back to 0.
	    	 It can also hurt or kill nearby players.
	   PROS: This unflips the vehicle at the nearest possible location. The vehicle can still be
	         stuck inside e.g. house, but will be unfliped. Vehicle is moved with physics.
	2) Use findEmptyPosition. (Or create invisible helipad instead of findEmptyPosition)
	   CONS: The new location is guaranteeed to be empty. This can also cause the vehicle to be moved
	         very far away. The vehicle is teleported.
	   PROS: No damage to vehicle. No damage to players
